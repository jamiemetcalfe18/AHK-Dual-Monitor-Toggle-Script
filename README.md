# AHK-Dual-Monitor-Toggle-Script
[An AutoHotkey (AHK)](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script that toggles between using one and two monitors. Press the designated hotkey to quickly switch back and forth between a single display setup and an extended dual monitor configuration.

#Why?
I have two computers. One is my project machine/home lab (Ubuntu), the other is my daily driver (Win 11). This allows me to switch between one and two monitor mode on my daily driver effortlessly. 
Now, I'm aware there's hardware that can do this, however it is a bit expensive and this is a easy solution until I can afford that hardware. 

I also wanted to toy around with AHK and get to know it better.
