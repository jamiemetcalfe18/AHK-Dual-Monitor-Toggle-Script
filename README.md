# AHK-Dual-Monitor-Toggle-Script
[An AutoHotkey (AHK)](https://www.autohotkey.com/) v2.0 script that toggles between using one and two monitors on windows. Press the designated hotkey to quickly switch back and forth between a single display setup and an extended dual monitor configuration.
You will need [NirCmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) installed for this script to work.

This is customized for my work space to go down from 2->1, with the second monitor becoming primary, then revers back from 1->2 with the 'new' monitor swapping to primary. 

# Why?
I have two computers. One is my project machine/home lab (Ubuntu), the other is my daily driver (Win 11). This allows me to switch between one and two monitor mode on my daily driver effortlessly. 
Now, I'm aware there's hardware that can do this, however it is a bit expensive and this is a easy solution until I can afford that hardware. 

I also wanted to toy around with AHK and get to know it better.

In the future, I will try to improve on this. If you would like to contribue, improve, or add anything, feel free!
